# MapProject5
For Udacity FED course Lesson 5, a map with filterable markers using google API. 

The initial markers are points of interest around Cleveland, and they are selectable from the map and the list view on the right.  You can type in words which will filter matching string in the name and addresses of the locations.  

When you select a location, then you will get wikipedia links related to the location if there are any on the bottom right, and the first yelp business found on the left.  There will be a picture as well, assuming a business is found.
